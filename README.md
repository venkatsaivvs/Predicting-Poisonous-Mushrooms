# Predicting-Poisonous-Mushrooms

This is a predictive modeling project to predict whether a mushroom is poisonous or edible using its properties including stalk color, odor, cap color, stalk root type and so on. Reducing the levels of various variables has been done based on response rate and frequency rate, Chi square test of independence has been conducted to find the strength of association between categories. Models including Naive Bayes, decision tree has been biult.

Interpreting the results of EDA,Chi-Square tests and decision tree showed us some interesting facts that odor of mushroom plays the most important role in determining the poisonous/Edibility of a mushroom

Below is the result of EDA  THe plot tell us that if a mushroom has a category of f,c  it may be poisonous and edible if its n.

We need a statistical proof to accept this. To see the statistical significance, below is the result of mosaic plot that shows Odor is statistically associated with poisonous or edibility of a mushroom
